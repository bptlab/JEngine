This guide explains how you can contribute to the project.

## Vision

Chimera is an engine for executing case models. 
It implements the [fragment-based Case Management approach](https://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/Public) that was developed at the [*Business Process Technology* (BPT) group](https://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/Public).
Being developed at an university, Chimera is a research prototype, that aims to be useful for research & teaching.
We try to follow established open source principles to teach them to our students.
